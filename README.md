# Machine Learning Solutions To Support Pet Adoption

### This GitHub repo is a collaborative final project for University of Arizona's Data Analytics Bootcamp.
### Authors: Elizabeth S., Jagrati Joshi, Natalie Smith, Ran Wei, and Veronica Nixon. 

#### We were concerned by the pet rescue crisis that unfolded during the 2021 winter storms in Austin, Texas and across the south and geared our final project towards exploring machine learning tools and data visualization approaches to support pet rescue and adoption efforts. Using pubicly available data from PetFinder.com and the Austin ___ we experimented with a variety of machine learning and data visualization solutions to learn about the pet adoption situation in Texas and to create tools to help people connect more easily with adoptable pets.

-"Pic-A-Pet": A machine learning system that provides an interactive experience similar to Tinder or Pandora where prospective pet adopters can vote pets up and down and get iteratively improved recommendations. This system is currently under construction. The code for the system can be viewed in the Pic-a-pet_Recommender_ML_System directory.

Key software, languages, libraries, and other technologies used: Python, sklearn library, Python CountVectorizer tool, Python cosine_similarity tool, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Python Flask library, Python numpy library, Pandas, json, MongoDB Cloud, PyMongo,
